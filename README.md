# Cloud Provisioning & Deployment CLI üöÄ

A Python-based command-line tool that automates the entire lifecycle of cloud infrastructure on Azure. This tool provisions a complete VM stack from scratch, deploys a containerized web application, and tears down all resources with a single set of commands.

## ‚ú® Live Demo

This recording shows the tool's full workflow:
1.  `provision`: Building the entire cloud infrastructure.
2.  `deploy`: Deploying the dynamic web application using Docker.
3.  `destroy`: Tearing down all cloud resources.

##  Workflow Architecture

This tool automates a 3-step process, all managed from a single CLI.

Step 1 'provision' points to an Azure cloud icon containing a VM, VNet, and NSG. 
Step 2 'deploy' shows Docker and a code icon pointing to the VM. 
Step 3 'destroy' shows the Azure resources being deleted.]

1.  **Provision:** The `provision` command communicates with the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API using the Azure SDK to build all necessary resources (VM, VNet, Public IP, NSG) based on the Python script's logic.
2.  **Deploy:** The `deploy` command:
    * Generates a dynamic `index.html` dashboard.
    * Connects to the VM via SSH (Paramiko).
    * Installs Docker on the remote VM.
    * Uploads the `Dockerfile` and the generated web application.
    * Builds a new Nginx Docker image on the VM.
    * Runs the container, mapping port 80 to serve the web dashboard.
3.  **Destroy:** The `destroy` command calls the Azure CLI to delete the entire resource group, removing all created resources and stopping all costs.

## Core Features

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manages all cloud resources programmatically, ensuring repeatable and consistent environments.
* **Automated Provisioning:** Creates a complete, secure cloud environment (VM, VNet, Public IP, Firewall) with one command.
* **Containerized Deployment:** Deploys a dynamic web application dashboard using **Docker** and **Nginx**, showcasing a modern, container-based workflow.
* **Full Lifecycle Management:** Includes a `destroy` command to tear down all resources, demonstrating full control over the infrastructure lifecycle.
* **State Management:** Uses a local `state.json` file to track the provisioned infrastructure's IP address and metadata.
